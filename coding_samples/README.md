# Coding Samples

*Created By: Akshat Kumar*

**Last Updated: 8th September, 2025**

This repositroy contains two coding samples for Akshat Kumar's Pre-Doctoral Application. This readme contains a brief description of the samples and their origin. For more details on what the files perform, please see the headers of the respective scripts.

## python_sample

This script contains a webscraper to scarpe bibliographic information of books in the Indian National Library's online catalog found [here](https://nationallibraryopac.nvli.in/). One can scrape books under certain Dewey Decimal Codes and certain major languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Urdu, Kannada, Bengali, English). The scarping is done using the BeautifulSoup package. To replicate the code, we don't need any input data, the user just needs to declare their device header. 

**NOTE:** This code was orginally written while working as an RA for Reka Juhasz. All the code in this file is my own work. 

## stata_sample

This script contains code to replicate certain figures and tables from the following [paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161965):

    Jensen, Robert, and Nolan H. Miller. 2018. "Market Integration, Demand, and the Growth of Firms: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in India." American Economic Review 108 (12): 3583â€“3625.
    DOI: 10.1257/aer.20161965

I have not included the data but it can easily be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113171/version/V1/view). 

**NOTE:** This code was orginally writtten for a replication excercise as part of my coursework at UBC. The script contains original code as the figures in the Jensen paper were made in excel and not STATA. I worked on this code alone.
